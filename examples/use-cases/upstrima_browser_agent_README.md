# Browser Automation for Upstrima Oil and Gas AI Platform

This guide demonstrates how to create browser automation agents for the Upstrima Oil and Gas AI Platform using the browser-use library. The example shows how to create agents that can interact with web interfaces, capture data, and automate workflows commonly used by petroleum engineers.

## Example Implementation

```python
from browser_use import Agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
import asyncio

async def main():
    llm = ChatOpenAI(model='gpt-4o')
    agent = Agent(
        task="""Go to https://gain.energy and perform the following steps:
1. Wait for the main page to fully load and take a screenshot of the hero section
2. Scroll down slowly to see the product features and take a screenshot
3. Scroll further to see the pricing section and take a final screenshot""",
        llm=llm,
    )
    result = await agent.run()
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Key Features for Oil & Gas Applications

1. **Automated Data Capture**
   - Screenshot capabilities for capturing well data visualizations
   - Ability to scroll through and capture long-form technical reports
   - Automated navigation through multi-page dashboards

2. **Intelligent Navigation**
   - GPT-4 powered understanding of complex oil & gas interfaces
   - Ability to locate and interact with specific data points
   - Smart handling of dynamic content loading

3. **Quality Assurance**
   - Automatic waiting for page elements to load
   - Verification of data visibility before capture
   - Error handling for network issues

## Common Use Cases

1. **Well Data Collection**
   ```python
   task="""Navigate to well dashboard, capture:
   1. Current production rates
   2. Pressure readings
   3. Temperature logs
   Export data in specified format"""
   ```

2. **Reservoir Analysis**
   ```python
   task="""Access reservoir model page:
   1. Load historical production data
   2. Capture performance graphs
   3. Download simulation results"""
   ```

3. **Equipment Monitoring**
   ```python
   task="""Monitor equipment dashboard:
   1. Check status indicators
   2. Capture maintenance alerts
   3. Document performance metrics"""
   ```

## Best Practices

1. **Task Definition**
   - Be specific about data points to capture
   - Include waiting conditions for dynamic content
   - Specify exact sections or elements to interact with

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement retry logic for network issues
   - Validate data before capture
   - Log all interactions for debugging

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use selective screenshots for relevant data
   - Implement efficient navigation patterns
   - Minimize unnecessary page loads

## Setup Requirements

1. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install browser-use langchain-openai
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
   BROWSER_USE_LOGGING_LEVEL=info
   ```

## Integration Tips

1. **Custom Actions**
   - Define specialized actions for oil & gas specific interactions
   - Create reusable task templates
   - Implement domain-specific validation

2. **Data Processing**
   - Add post-processing for captured data
   - Implement export formats suitable for engineering analysis
   - Create data validation checks

3. **Security Considerations**
   - Handle credentials securely
   - Implement session management
   - Follow company security protocols

## Example Workflows

1. **Daily Production Monitoring**
   ```python
   task="""Daily production check workflow:
   1. Login to platform
   2. Navigate to production dashboard
   3. Capture key metrics
   4. Generate daily report"""
   ```

2. **Maintenance Scheduling**
   ```python
   task="""Equipment maintenance workflow:
   1. Check maintenance schedules
   2. Capture upcoming tasks
   3. Document equipment status
   4. Export maintenance calendar"""
   ```

This documentation provides a foundation for creating browser automation agents specifically tailored for petroleum engineering applications. The examples and patterns can be adapted for various use cases within the Upstrima platform.
